    I'd like to thank [@geertvanbommel](https://github.com/geertvanbommel),
    a fellow software architect specializing in database batch processing and
    API development, for sponsoring the first release! ðŸŽ‰
    Thanks to sponsors like this, who understand the importance of open source
    development, I can justify spending time and focus on open source development
    instead of traditional paid work.
